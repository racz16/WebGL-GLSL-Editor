# More information about the project

If you want to know more about a project structure, how to build, run, package, and much more, read the [extension's wiki page](https://github.com/racz16/WebGL-GLSL-Editor/wiki).

Originally this file contained this information, but over time it grew too big, that's why I moved it into the wiki. This file is here for compatibility reasons.
